*IMPORTANT*
Definitely not the best project as it was the first 'real' on that I had created but it was decent start considering I had no prior experience.

- It's messy.
- A fair bit of duplicate code.
- Countless amounts of dead code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming project for university. Free style wave based project.

MOVEMENT - 'W' 'A' 'S' 'D'
SHOOTING - 'UP' 'LEFT' 'DOWN' 'RIGHT'

EXTRAS - 'G' for GodMode (Cannot die and unlimited ammo).
'N' for NormalMode (Switch from GodMode back to NormalMode).

GOAL - Survive as many waves as possible without dying / falling off the edge of the level
and any new highscores will update on the menu.

PICKUPS - Pickups spawn every 15 seconds if there are no pickups in game.
The GREEN flashing blocks with the GREEN '+' are health. YELLOW flashing blocks are ammo.

ENEMIES - PURPLE are slow enemeies with high attack, WHITE are fast enemies with
low attack and PINK are 'normal' enemines with a balanced attack.

BOSS WAVE - During the boss wave bombs will 'spawn' every few seconds starting from the
bottom left of the level. The player can use these bombs to kill the boss but the player
also takes damage from the explosion.


This project took me an unecessary amount of time to get to this current stage.

Have fun and good luck! :)
